# SoftSharp

SoftSharp is a software 3D rasterizer written in C#. I wrote it in late 2009 as a means to teach myself how to render 3D graphics without using OpenGL or D3D. Included is a simple demo of a smooth shaded, rotating 3D model (lifted from Sami "MENTAL" Hamlaoui's NeHe tutorial on cel shading) with a directional light applied to it. It also supports basic texture mapping, and comes with a reasonably complete vector/matrix library. I never got around to solving the problem with small cracks in between polygons, or the occasional awkward vertex extrusions. It could be much better, but the intent was purely educational. Releasing under the MIT license, so do whatever with it. If you do find something here useful, please give me a shout out! twitter.com/hackerwatson
